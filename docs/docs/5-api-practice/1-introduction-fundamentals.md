# Introduction & API Testing Fundamentals

## Overview

This session covers the essential concepts and best practices in API testing,
focusing on authentication, security, and common challenges.

## Key Topics

### API Testing Best Practices

Here are some best practices in API testing:

| Best Practice                | Description                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Define Clear Requirements    | Understand and document the API specifications, including endpoints, request/response formats, and error codes.          |
| Test for Different Scenarios | Cover various scenarios, including positive, negative, boundary, and edge cases. This is about **input**                 |
| Validate Responses           | Check the correctness of responses, including status codes, headers, and body content. This is all about **output**       |
| Monitor Performance          | Test API performance under load to identify bottlenecks and ensure scalability.                                          |
| Security Testing             | Conduct security assessments to identify vulnerabilities, such as authentication and data protection.                    |
| Version Control              | Manage API versions to ensure backward compatibility and smooth transitions for users.                                   |
| Use Mock Services            | Utilize mock servers for testing to simulate API behavior without relying on actual services.                            |
| Document Test Cases          | Maintain clear documentation of test cases and results for future reference and audits.                                  |
| Use Automated Testing        | Implement automated tests to ensure consistent and repeatable testing, especially for regression testing. **From day 1** |
| Continuous Integration       | Integrate API tests into the CI/CD pipeline to catch issues early in the development process. **From day 1**             |

Implementing these practices helps ensure robust and reliable APIs.
